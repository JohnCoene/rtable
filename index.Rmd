# rtable

An R wrapper to the [Airtable API](https://airtable.com/api).

## Install

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JohnCoene/rtable")
```

## APIs

rtable comes with two APIs, classic and R6, both come with the same functionalities.

## Setup

This document will help you get setup. First head to [Airtable](https://airtable.com) and create an account if you do not have one already. Once logged in head to your [account page](https://airtable.com/account), where you should see your token.

You are advised placing your token as a environment variable in your `.Renviron` file. The easiest way to do so is using the [usethis package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/).

```r
# install.packages(usethis)
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

Then place the following inside.

```r
RTABLE_API_KEY = "<my_api_key>"
```

This way the token will be loaded automatically in your session, it is also much more secure than including it in R scripts and Shiny apps.

Either APIs _require_:

1. An API key (described above)
2. A base id (described below)

To obtain your base id head to the [API documentation page](https://airtable.com/api) and select the base you want to work with. The base id will be the URL of the resulting page (first element in path), it starts with `app`, i.e.: `appeDnXpirVfc0UAh`
